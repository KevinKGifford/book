# Report

As a class, we brainstormed and came up with a long list of further questions we can ask based
on the "self-introduction" data. Out of these questions, our team chose to tackle on
the following:

# What percentage of the class are Computer Science students?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# What are the favorite programming languages for the class participants?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}


# How many students commented on the Introduction Issue before the first class?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}

# How many students have updated their initial Introdcution comments?

{% lodash %}
return "[answer]"
{% endlodash %}
